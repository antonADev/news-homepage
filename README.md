## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- Styled-Components
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React-Router-Dom
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.4.3) - React framework

### What I learned

It is always a pleasure to review all the topics studied during my learning path. In this project I wanted to brush up on my skills to optimally use grid layout, use react to create a UI as similar as possible to requests and react-router-dom, even if just implemented in a simple way without any pages to show.

### Continued development

Next step is to get another challenge and try out, or improve, new skills and topics. For example I want to review my RTK and RTK queries knowledge.
